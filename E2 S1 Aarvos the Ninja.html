         <h4>
         <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"></font>On the Friday, Aarvos was moving on the footpath, suddenly
            <br>
            He saw a villain named turtas, destroying the City.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"></font> Aarvos jumped down with his Stick which he got from
                <br>
                Avenger's manager. He was little nervous because it was the
                <br>
                It was his First fight.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"></font>Turtas weapon was a worthy chain. He was the first to 
                    <br>
                    Attack by pushing Aarvos with his chain. Aarvos fell 
                    <br>
                    On the ground and got up with his stick.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"></font>  Aarvos gave a kick to turtas and hit him with his stick.
                    <br>
                    Turtas got up and said “kid, you have the power but,
                    <br>
                    You can't beat me, I am the strongest!”
                    <br>
                    “Hey, you are stronger than me. I'm not afraid of you”.
                    <br>
                    Turtas got angry and fight with Aarvos and then,
                    <br>
                    Aarvos won the war and he was the ultimate Savior of
                    <br>
                    The city.
