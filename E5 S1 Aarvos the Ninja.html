         <h4>
         <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"></font>On the Tuesday, when Aarvos was walking on
            <br>
            The footpath some smoke was coming from a
            <br>
            Device, Aarvos immediately realized it was done
            <br>
            By Turtlas.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>           
            <p align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"></font>Aarvos quickly walk to the corner and wore his  
                <br>           
                   Suit. He walked to the smoke and suddenly, Turtlas
                   <br>
Came and said “you have killed my brother, now I
<br>
Will kill you in Turn”. In turn it was opposite
<br>
Aarvos was beating the Turtlas and he cannot
<br>
Even touch the Aarvos. Turtlas knew was 
<br>
Losing so, he ran away.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Then he went to his favourite park and was
    <br>
    Worried about the protection of loving ones.
    <br>
    He saw Suit was tore and he was confused
    <br>
    What to do. Suddenly, a bright flash came
    <br>
    Aarvos picked it up and it was a powerful
    <br>
    Stone. It suddenly started floating and his
    <br>
    Suit was now, more powerful, stitched and
    <br>
    Now, he felt well and too excited to
    <br>
     Examine the stone.
