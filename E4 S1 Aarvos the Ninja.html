         <h4>
         <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"></font>On the Monday Aarvos was sitting in his room
            <br>
            Drawing a stickman with a stick and showing
            <br>
That he was saving everybody from Turtas and
<br>
 Was making Himself in his own drawing.
 <br>
Then he decided to sleep. (Zzzzâ€¦.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"></font> When Aarvos woke up he hurriedly got ready and 
    <br>
    Gone out for a walk. He purchased a chocolate
    <br>
    And went eating it to the park. He sat on
    <br>
    Grass and thought about the future that,
    <br>
    Will happen in future.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"></font>Aarvos thought that he should again practice
        <br>
The Skills of his Stick and went to a silent
<br>
Place where he practiced old as well as new
<br>
Skills.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"></font>When he was returning to his home he saw
    <br>
    The Brother of Turtas challenging for a war
    <br>
    And from looking closely he saw the same
    <br>
    Chain which his brother, Turtas had.
    <br>
    His name was Turtlas.
